# Personal Tech Radar

A personalized, AI-powered technology assessment and visualization platform that helps users track and evaluate emerging technologies based on their individual preferences and risk appetite.

## Overview

The Personal Tech Radar is an intelligent system that continuously monitors the technology landscape, assesses new technologies, and presents them in a radar visualization format similar to ThoughtWorks' Tech Radar. The system uses AI agents to automate the discovery, assessment, and categorization of technologies while taking into account individual user preferences.

## Core Components

### 1. User Profile & Technology Appetite
- User preferences and risk tolerance settings
- Technology domain interests
- Industry context and constraints
- Historical technology adoption patterns
- Custom assessment criteria

### 2. Technology Discovery Agent
- Web crawler for configured sources (GitHub, tech blogs, news sites, etc.)
- Periodic scanning for new technologies
- Initial filtering based on user preferences
- Technology metadata extraction
- Source credibility assessment

### 3. Technology Assessment Agent
- Multi-factor technology evaluation:
  - Maturity and stability
  - Community adoption and support
  - Documentation quality
  - Integration complexity
  - Security considerations
  - Performance characteristics
  - Cost implications
- AI-powered analysis of technology reviews and discussions
- Sentiment analysis of community feedback
- Risk assessment based on user's appetite

### 4. Radar Categorization Engine
- Classification into quadrants:
  - Languages & Frameworks
  - Tools
  - Platforms
  - Techniques
- Ring placement logic:
  - Adopt: Ready for immediate use
  - Trial: Worth exploring with caution
  - Assess: Keep under observation
  - Hold: Not recommended for now
- Time-based tracking of technology evolution

### 5. Visualization System
- Interactive radar visualization
- Time-window based views
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Technology detail views
- Historical trend analysis
- Export and sharing features
